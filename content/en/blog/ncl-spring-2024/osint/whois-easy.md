# WHOIS (Easy)

You could totally use a WHOIS lookup website to answer these, but I love using the command-line whenever possible. 

Example websites for reference:
- https://www.whois.com/whois/
- https://lookup.icann.org/en
- https://mxtoolbox.com/whois.aspx

Otherwise, you can use `whois` on pretty much any system.
