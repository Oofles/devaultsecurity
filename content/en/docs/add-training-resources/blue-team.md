## Subscription-based
- [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com) 
  - My personal favorite, but I'm a tad biased... 
- [Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/)
  - They have free courses, but the up-to-date stuff is paid. The content is decent, but nothing super advanced
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
  - Hit or miss on the content here. Price per course model
- [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/)
  - Good for management or "personal skills" type courses

## Individual Paid Courses
- [Cyber Defenders](https://cyberdefenders.org)
  - Free CTF style challenges for blue team - mostly digital forensics and malware analysis. Paid certification option.
- [TCM Security](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/courses)
   - Pay per course model. It gets great reviews, but I haven't taken any of the courses yet.
- [Antisyphon InfoSec Training (Pay What You Can)](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/)
  - Great set of course and super-accessible!
- [SecureNinja](https://secureninja.com/)
  - Live training options - mostly certification prep

## Free Training
- [Linux Foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/resources/?_sft_content_type=free-course)
  - Mix of training options / mixed reviews
- [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/training/free)
  - These are more Engineering focused than anything, but the free courses serve to give a decent overview on some of the various capabilities
- [SANS Cyber Aces](https://www.sans.org/cyberaces/)
  - Old courses, but serves as a good foundation to start with
- [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/resources/learning-paths/cybersecurity-foundations/)
- [OST2 - Open Security Training](https://ost2.fyi/)
  - Excellent assembly and firmware courses! 
- [Open Security Training](https://opensecuritytraining.info/Training.html)
  - The predecessor to OST2, though still has available courses
