<br>

I currently work as an Education Architect for [Elastic](elastic.co) performing security consulting and education primarily in the federal space. I am constantly developing new security curriculum focused around **threat hunting** and **incident response**. Check out some of the courses I've authored here: [Elastic Private Training](https://www.elastic.co/training/private-training).

I also serve as a community manager for the [Jacksonville Elastic Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Jacksonville-Elasticsearch-Meetup-Group/).

I am also a current member of the Florida Air National Guard. I work as a cyber security analyst and incident responder for the [601st Air Operations Center's](https://www.1af.acc.af.mil/Library/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/289621/601st-air-and-space-operations-center/) Mission Defense Team.

Experience here includes tools such as Snort, Bro, Elastic, deep packet analysis with Wireshark and tcpdump, and numerous other open-source tools for continuous monitoring and Blue Team operations.

I developed the operational training plan for AFNORTH's cyber security teams focused on air defense mission systems.

<h1 class="text-center">Perched</h1>
<h5 class="text-center">Mar 2019 - Aug 2019</h5>


<br>

Prior to working at Elastic, I worked as a Solutions Engineer for a small startup called [Perched](https://www.elastic.co/blog/welcome-perched-security-training-for-siem-threat-hunting-and-more). 

Here I was a content contributer and educator of tailored courses for Cyber Security Operators in industry and the Department of Defense. I also performed consulting for Elastic deployments and threat hunting inside the Elastic Stack.

In August 2019, Perched was acquired by Elastic and it's been an awesome journey ever since!
