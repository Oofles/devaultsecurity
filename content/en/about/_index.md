<h1 class="text-center">Harris Corporation</h1>
<h5 class="text-center">Dec 2011 - Sep 2016</h5>
<br><br>
My life prior to full-time military and security operations had me down a different path. Honestly, I'm suprised you are still reading at this point, but thanks for sticking with me! 
<br><br>
At Harris I began my programming background working with a team developing a Java application delivering live geo-spatial visualizations of military assets. This application also gave me the opportunity to develop visualizations for the SOCOM Wargame Center and drive the system (a 20'x32' 3D floor display) for International and US Cabinet-level events.
